            <p>Hello! My name is Sydney Solomon, and I am from Hawaii. I am of Polynesian descent. I enjoy sports and computers/technologies.
                I went on a mission to Guatemala City East Mission. I used to play Center for a Junior College in Norwalk, CA at Cerritos College
                and got recruited to play football at a Division 1 FBS at Troy University in Troy, Alabama. My interests are listed below.
            </p>

                <li>Sports</li>
                <li>Cooking</li>

            <p>
                Here is a picture of my baby. He was born on November 10th of this year. He is a mix of Mexican-Hawaiian. His name is Jacob.
                When he's fed, he is a very chill guy.

        <p>Laie, Hawaii is where I am from. I lived in a beach town, and going to the beach and spending time with family were always the best times of my life. It is warm year-round, rarely dropping below 65 degrees. It is very humid, and when hot, you can't really tell what is sweat or just the humid air. It is home to BYU-Hawaii and the great Polynesian Cultural Center.</p>
