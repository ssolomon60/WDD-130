        Here is a picture of my baby. He was born November 10th of this year. He is a mix of Mexican-Hawaiian. His name is Jacob. When he's fed, he is a very chill guy.

        Here is a picture of my better half. We dated for two years before we got married. We were married in the Ogden, Utah temple and it was probably one of the two best things that has happened to me in my life.

        <p>Laie, Hawaii is where I am from. I lived in a beach town, and going to the beach and spending time with family were always the best times of my life. It is warm year-round, rarely dropping below 65 degrees. It is very humid, and when hot, you can't really tell what is sweat or just the humid air. It is home to BYU-Hawaii and the great Polynesian Cultural Center.</p>
