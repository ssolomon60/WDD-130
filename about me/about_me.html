                    <p>My name is Sydney Solomon, and I am from Hawaii. I am of Polynesian descent and enjoy sports, computers, and technology. I was born in Hawaii, raised in South Dakota, went to school in California, and attended Servite High School where I played football.</p>
                    <p>I went on a mission to the Guatemala City East Mission. I used to play Center for Cerritos College in Norwalk, CA, and was recruited to play football at Troy University in Alabama.</p>
                    <p>I have a son that was born in November 10th of 2025 and he is probably the biggest blessing, other than my wife, to be part of my life. </p>
                    <p>I have a wide range of experiences, from managing a restaurant to custodial work and logistics.</p>
